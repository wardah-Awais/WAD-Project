## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This backend project is developed using Node.js and Express.js as part of the WAD semester course. It demonstrates a complete RESTful API system with secure user authentication and role-based access control. It also includes CRUD operations on multiple models and image file uploads using Multer.

The backend handles three core entities:
- Users (registration, login, update, delete)
- Products (with image upload)
- Orders (user-specific)
